# Welcome to My Résumé Repository

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for my résumé, built using the elegant [`moderncv`](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) package.

It serves as a version-controlled and reproducible format of my curriculum vitae, allowing for easy updates and clean formatting using LaTeX.
